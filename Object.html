        //How to define and Object

        //THE FIRST OBJECT I MADE
 const p1 ={

    name : "Prasanna",
    age:17,
    "RaiseHand": function(){
        window.alert("The player " +p1.name+" of age "+ p1.age+" has raised his hands")
    }


   };
//THE SECOND OBJECT I MADE
  const p2 ={
name: "Shyam",
age:23,
"Yell": function(){
    window.alert("The player "+p2.name+" of age "+p2.age+"has YELLED at the teacher!!!")
}


  };
//IM CALLING OUT THE FUNCTION

   // p2["Yell"]();


  //now new way to write functions

function player(name,marker){
this.name=name;
this.marker=marker;
this.sayname= function(){
  document.write(this.name);
};
}
const pp1= new player("steve", "X");

//p1.sayname();
//p2.sayname();




//Here, If i don't use the "New Operator",it can bring very much erros later.. so LETS make the codes such that i need the operator New For using the operators


function car(name,color)
{    
    if(!new.target){
        throw Error("You must use the operator new to access this constructor");
        
    }
    this.name=name;
    this.color=color;
    this.Sayname= function(){
        document.write("The name of the car is "+this.name+" And the color of the car is "+this.color)
    };
}

const c1 =  new car("BMW","black");

c1.Sayname();
